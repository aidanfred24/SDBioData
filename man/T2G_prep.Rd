\title{TERM2GENE Data Prep for iDEP Database}
\usage{
T2G_prep(species_id = NULL, category = "GOBP", genes = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{species_id}{Numeric. The ID of a desired species from database, found
using \code{srch_species()}}

\item{category}{Character. A vector or character constant of pathway
categories/databases (e.g. KEGG, GOBP, GOCC, etc.). It is not recommended to
use all categories, as some species have many, leading to performance issues}

\item{genes}{Character. A character vector of genes to add to query}
}
\value{
A data frame containing TERM2GENE Data (pathways to genes)
}
\description{
Prepares background genes for enrichment analysis functions in the
format of TERM2GENE data, using pathway information from various databases.
Requires ID for a species, and can filter for specific vector of genes.
